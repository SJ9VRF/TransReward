## Approach Overview

This approach applies reward compensation to facilitate effective transfer learning between robots with differing dynamics and tasks. We initiate the process by establishing baseline policy models and reward structures for the source and target robots. Data is then collected from both environments by executing current policies, which is essential for assessing performance disparities and alignment needs. The key step involves calculating a reward compensation factor that adjusts the reward signals to account for these differences. This compensation helps to align the target robot's learning objectives with those of the source task, thereby enhancing task adaptability and performance consistency across different robotic platforms.

### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Initialization:** Set up initial policy models for source and target robots along with their respective reward structures.
2. **Data Collection:** Perform policy executions in both the source and target environments to gather necessary performance data.
3. **Reward Compensation Calculation:** Analyze the collected data to determine the disparities in task execution and outcomes. Calculate the necessary reward adjustments to minimize these differences.
4. **Policy Update:** Apply the calculated reward adjustments to the target policy, refining it to better mirror the successful aspects of the source policy.
5. **Iterative Refinement:** Repeat the data collection, reward adjustment, and policy update steps until the target robot's policy performance aligns with the source, or meets the convergence criteria.

This approach leverages the interplay between reward compensation and policy adaptation, using the dynamics of both robots to optimize learning transfer. By adjusting the reward structure, we facilitate a more seamless integration of learned behaviors and skills across different robots and tasks, even when their operational environments and inherent capabilities significantly differ.






## Reward Transfer Formulation

### Reward Structures and Data Collection

Each robot operates within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined by states \( s \), actions \( a \), and rewards \( r \). The experiences of the source and target robots are represented as tuples \( (s_s, a_s, r_s) \) and \( (s_t, a_t, r_t) \), respectively.

### Calculating Reward Compensation

The objective is to adjust the target's reward \( r_t \) based on the successful experiences \( r_s \) of the source. The fundamental formulation for reward compensation is given by the reward transformation function:

#### Reward Transformation Function

\[ r'_t = r_t + \Delta r(s_t, a_t) \]

Where:
- \( r'_t \) is the adjusted reward for the target.
- \( \Delta r(s_t, a_t) \) is the reward compensation function, dependent on the target's states and actions.

#### Determining \( \Delta r(s_t, a_t) \)

This function is defined as:

\[ \Delta r(s_t, a_t) = \lambda \cdot (r_s^* - r_t) \]

Here:
- \( r_s^* \) represents an estimated optimal reward that the source robot would receive in a state-action pair analogous to \( (s_t, a_t) \).
- \( \lambda \) is a scaling factor, potentially adjusted based on the similarity between states \( s_s \) and \( s_t \), or other relevant factors such as reward variance, to normalize impacts across different contexts.

### Implementation of Reward Compensation

To implement this in a learning system:
1. **Estimate \( r_s^* \)**: Utilize a function approximator, such as a neural network, trained on the source's data to predict the reward \( r_s^* \) for the target's current state-action pair \( (s_t, a_t) \).
   
2. **Apply \( \Delta r \)**: Modify the targetâ€™s reward signal in its learning algorithm by incorporating \( \Delta r(s_t, a_t) \) into the original reward \( r_t \).

### Iterative Refinement

This involves iterative updates where:
- The target continues to gather data \( (s_t, a_t, r_t) \) under its policy, now influenced by \( r'_t \).
- The reward transformation function is periodically refined based on fresh data, enhancing \( \Delta r(s_t, a_t) \) to better synchronize the learning processes.

### Mathematical Optimization

Formulate an optimization problem to minimize the expected difference in outcomes due to reward discrepancies:

\[ \min_{\Delta r} \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t) \sim \pi_t} \left[ \left(r_s^* - (r_t + \Delta r(s_t, a_t))\right)^2 \right] \]

Where \( \pi_t \) is the policy followed by the target.

This structured approach to adjusting reward mechanisms enables the target robot to effectively utilize successful strategies from the source, optimizing learning in complex adaptive systems where direct training from scratch is inefficient or slow.
